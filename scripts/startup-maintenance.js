// The purpose of this is to be a place for any logic that needs to run at
// startup, before the service goes back online. It is not a script in the
// typical sense, in that it can / should only be invoked from the main
// thread, when the database is not otherwise being written to.
//
// The use case is primarily to support releases that involve changes to data
// in any of the databases (e.g. after refactoring, bug fixes, etc).
//
// The intention is that it should be safe to run any of these tasks multiple
// times, and that once they have been run at least once in production, any
// actions configured to run here will be removed from subsequent releases.
